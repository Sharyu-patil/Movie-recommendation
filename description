I created a movie recommendation system in Python to provide personalized movie suggestions based on user preferences. The system used Cosine Similarity to measure how closely users tastes matched, enabling accurate recommendations. I processed and cleaned raw user data to remove inconsistencies, ensuring the recommendation engine worked effectively. Using Python, I implemented an algorithm to calculate the similarity between user preferences and identify users with similar interests. This allowed the system to suggest movies they were likely to enjoy. To evaluate the systemâ€™s performance, I used metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score, which helped ensure the recommendations were accurate and relevant. This project helped me apply Python for data processing, algorithm design, and performance evaluation. It also strengthened my skills in building user-centered systems, enhancing personalization and delivering practical solutions to real-world problems.
